### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I wrote Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics some of which are:

   - 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
        - most common month
        - most common day of week
        - most common hour of day

   - 2 Popular stations and trip
        - most common start station
        - most common end station
        - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

   - 3 Trip duration
        - total travel time
        - average travel time

   - 4 User info
        - counts of each user type
        - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
        - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
In this project, dataset from https://www.motivateco.com/ was used.
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 were provided for the cities of Chicago, New York City and Washington:
